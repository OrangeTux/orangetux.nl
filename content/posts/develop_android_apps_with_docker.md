For a small project for school me and my teammate [Maurits van Mastrigt][mauvm]
had to create an Android app. We decided to use [Cordova][cordova]. This post
demonstrates how to build and install an Android app created with Cordova, but
you can use any other tool you like. We also wanted a Docker container which
would take care of the building and installation process. It turned out to be
quite easy to do (on a Linux machine).

## Start container
We used [this image][base_image] for our container. The image comes with
Cordova and some Android build tools.

Create a folder where you want your code to be and start the container like
this:

```
$ docker run -it --privileged -v $(pwd):/app -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
    ugnb/ubuntu-cordova-android-build /bin/bash
```

This command will start a container and mounts your (empty) code directory in
it. It also mounts the USB device nodes from your host machine into the
container. The `--privileged` flag gives the container access to all devices.
This way the container can access your Android phone via the USB debugger.

## Create app
First we need some code to build our app from.

```
$ cordova create /app com.github.orangetux SampleApp
```

This command will genere the code for your app in `/app` directory of your
container. Because this directory has been mounted from your host machine this
code should also be visible on your host. Now add support for Android:

```
$ cordova platform add android
```

## Debug USB
Before you can install the app on your phone the USB ports of your host should
be available in the conainter. Install `usbutils` in your container, connect
your Android phone with your host and check if you you can 'see' your phone by
running `lsusb`. Our phone is connected on bus 003 device 003.

```
root@0520d37b082e:/# lsusb
Bus 004 Device 003: ID 2232:1054
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 006 Device 002: ID 0cf3:3004 Atheros Communications, Inc.
Bus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 0bda:0129 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.
    RTS5129 Card Reader Controller
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 04e8:6860 Samsung Electronics Co.,
    Ltd GT-I9100 Phone [Galaxy S II], GT-I9300 Phone [Galaxy S III],
    GT-P7500 [Galaxy Tab 10.1]
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
```

When youre phone is connected start the [Android Debugger Bridge][adb] and
check if `adb` is able to to detect your phone as well:

```
root@c547f9b34347:/# adb devices
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
List of devices attached
4df792ad34de1187       unauthorized
```

This command will force a pop up on your phone asking for permission to use the
USB debugger. Accept it. When you run `adb devices` again you'll see that your
device has been authorized.

```
root@c547f9b34347:/# adb devices
List of devices attached
4df792ad34de1187    device
```

## Install app
Now you are ready to install the app on your phone. Assuming that you are in
the root directory of your app, build and install your application:

```
root@c547f9b34347:/app# cordova run --device
Running command: /app/platforms/android/cordova/run --device
Buildfile: /app/platforms/android/build.xml
...
BUILD SUCCESSFUL

Using apk: /app/platforms/android/ant-build/CordovaApp-debug.apk
Installing app on device...
12Launching application...
LAUNCH SUCCESS
```

Great, you build and installed your app from a Docker container!

## Automate
Now let's automate this stuff. We created a small `Dockerfile` and put the
commands used above in a script, both on your host system, of course.

```
FROM ugnb/ubuntu-cordova-android-build

# Volume where code of app will be mounted on.
VOLUME ["/app"]
WORKDIR /app

CMD ["/var/tools/build.sh"]
```

Create `build.sh` and put it somewhere in your project, we put in in a `tools/`
directory. Note line 13, this command removes the previously installed
application. Replace the package name with the name of your package.

``` bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
adb start-server

# This will force a pop up on your phone asking for permission
# to USB debugging.
adb devices

# Let's wait a few seconds so user has a chance to allow the
# USB debugging.
sleep 5

# Delete current installation of app if present.
echo ">> Deleting app..."
adb shell pm uninstall com.github.orangetux

cordova run --device
```

Build an image from `Dockerfile` once:

```
$ docker build -t="android"
```

And start the container:

```
$ docker run -it --privileged -v $(pwd):/app -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
    -v $(pwd)/tools:/var/tools android
```

## Troubleshooting
The process as described above works fine on a Linux machine. We had problems
on OSX. Docker runs on OSX inside VirtualBox which could cause problems with
mounting the USB device nodes through the VirtualBox layer in your docker
container.

Every time the container starts the "Allow USB debugging" pop up on your
Android phone pops op. Even if you checked "Always allow from this computer".
We don't exactly know how to fix this.

Sometimes the Android phone isn't visible inside the container or is
`unauthorized`. Unplug and plug your phone and restarting the container might
help.
